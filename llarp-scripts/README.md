# LLARP Script Library 🧩

## Concept: Code Legos for Router Management

This directory contains **proven, working scripts** that have been tested and validated on real OpenWRT routers. Each script is a "code lego" that can be combined with others to build complex router management workflows.

## 🎯 Philosophy

1. **Save Working Solutions**: Every successful operation becomes a reusable script
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Scripts are created from real regression tests
3. **Incremental Building**: Complex operations built from simple, proven legos
4. **AI Learning**: Scripts become part of the knowledge base for future AI decisions

## 📚 Available Script Legos

### Network Diagnostics
- `diagnose-connectivity.sh` - Comprehensive internet connectivity diagnosis
- `fix-wan-connectivity.sh` - Attempt to fix WAN connectivity issues

### Configuration Management  
- `change-hostname.sh` - Change router hostname safely
- `create-wifi-network.sh` - Create new WiFi networks with security

### System Operations
- (More legos will be added as we validate more operations)

## 🧪 Regression Test Results

### Router: 15.0.0.1 (LLARP)
**Date:** $(date)

| Test | Status | Script | Notes |
|------|--------|---------|-------|
| Connected devices | ✅ PASS | Manual SSH | Found: impera (15.0.0.174), unknown (15.0.0.233) |
| NTP server check | ✅ PASS | Manual SSH | 4 OpenWRT NTP pool servers configured |
| Change hostname | ✅ PASS | `change-hostname.sh` | "Zephyr" → "LLARP" successful |
| Package updates | ❌ FAIL | Manual SSH | WAN connectivity issues prevent access |
| WiFi network creation | ✅ PASS | `create-wifi-network.sh` | "llarp" network broadcasting |
| Connectivity diagnosis | ✅ PASS | `diagnose-connectivity.sh` | **ROOT CAUSE: NO-CARRIER on WAN interface** |

## 🔍 Key Findings

**Critical Issue Identified:**
- WAN interface in `NO-CARRIER` state (physical connectivity problem)
- Gateway 13.0.0.254 unreachable  
- Switching to DHCP didn't resolve (still no carrier)
- **Action Required:** Check physical WAN cable connection

**Successful Operations:**
- SSH connectivity: ✅ Reliable
- UCI configuration: ✅ Working perfectly
- WiFi management: ✅ Fully functional
- System monitoring: ✅ Complete visibility

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Physical Infrastructure**: Verify WAN cable connection
2. **VPN Server Setup**: Test without internet dependency
3. **Script Library Expansion**: Add more validated legos
4. **AI Integration**: Index these scripts for intelligent recommendations

## 💡 Usage Examples

```bash
# Test connectivity
./llarp-scripts/diagnose-connectivity.sh 15.0.0.1

# Create WiFi network
./llarp-scripts/create-wifi-network.sh 15.0.0.1 mynetwork password123

# Change hostname
./llarp-scripts/change-hostname.sh 15.0.0.1 MyRouter
```

Each script is self-contained and can be used independently or combined for complex workflows.
