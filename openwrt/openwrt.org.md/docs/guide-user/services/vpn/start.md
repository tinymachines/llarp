[VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual%20private%20network "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual private network") extends a private network across a public network providing connectivity and security. VPN typically relies on the [client-server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server%20model "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client–server model") model and works as L2TP or L3TP depending on the protocol and service configuration. There are multiple software packages to implement different VPN protocols, which are generally incompatible with each other.

## VPN server

The VPN server running on your router can provide a secure connection to your home network while you're away. If you need to access the router itself or any of your home network devices from afar, the VPN server is a great solution.

## VPN client

You may want to run a VPN client on your router to encrypt your connection to the internet and prevent your ISP from snooping on your traffic and DNS requests, which in some countries is now legal for ISPs to monetize, as well as meddling with DNS requests or HTTP traffic. In order to use a VPN client on your router, you would need to obtain credentials to a corresponding VPN server. Your connection to the VPN server is encrypted, preventing your ISP from snooping/meddling on your traffic. A wide variety of commercial VPN providers exist. Once you install and run a VPN client on your router, it's best to route all your traffic via a VPN tunnel.
