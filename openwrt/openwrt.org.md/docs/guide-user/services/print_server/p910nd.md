# p910nd

Description for the UCI configuration file `/etc/config/p910nd`.

For installations instructions and more see: [p910nd.server](/docs/guide-user/services/print_server/p910nd.server "docs:guide-user:services:print_server:p910nd.server"). You can run more than one printer at the same time by adding additional sections.

The default configuration is (list all configured printers):

```
uci show p910nd
```

## Configuration

Description of the options in the p910nd config file `/etc/config/p910nd`:

Option Type Default Description `enabled` boolean `0` `1`: Enable the printer; `0`: Disable the printer `device` device path /dev/usb/lp0 The device your printer is connected to (e.g. `/dev/usb/lp0`, `/dev/printers/0` for LPT under Linux 2.4; `/dev/lp0` for USB under Linux 2.6) `port` number (0-9) `0` The p910nd listening TCP port (9100 + *port*) `bidirectional` boolean `1` `1`: Turn on bidirectional copying; `0`: Turn off bidirectional copying `bind` IP address unknown The IP address to listen on (typically the same as LAN)

**Note:** Enabling the service might not work as expected (not starting the service at boot time) on current Barrier Breaker versions (as of 2014.05.13), see [this issue](https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/14909 "https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/14909").

## Example

```
# Add a printer
uci -q delete p910nd.prn1
uci set p910nd.prn1=p910nd
uci set p910nd.prn1.device=/dev/usb/lp1
uci set p910nd.prn1.port=1
uci set p910nd.prn1.bidirectional=1
uci set p910nd.prn1.enabled=1
uci commit p910nd
/etc/init.d/p910nd restart
Â 
# Delete the printer prn1
uci delete p910nd.prn1
uci commit p910nd
/etc/init.d/p910nd restart
```

- Under Linux 2.4, the device name for the printer would be of the form /dev/usb/lpn, where n is usually 0 for the first printer.
- Under Linux 2.6, the device name for the printing would be of the form /dev/lpn
