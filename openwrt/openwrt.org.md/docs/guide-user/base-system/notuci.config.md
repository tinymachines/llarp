# System configuration not handled by UCI

A lot of stuff can (and therefore should be) configured with [uci](/docs/guide-user/base-system/uci "docs:guide-user:base-system:uci") via any of its interfaces. This page concerns itself with everything built into OpenWrt that cannot be configured with UCI. Note that most third party applications, installed with [opkg](/docs/guide-user/additional-software/opkg "docs:guide-user:additional-software:opkg") or otherwise, typically also have their own configuration methods. Users experienced with GNU/Linux distribution will know all of this by heart. For beginners this should be useful.

## Configuration files

Configuration Description `/etc/banner` Login welcome banner. `/etc/crontabs` See: [Cron](/docs/guide-user/base-system/cron "docs:guide-user:base-system:cron") `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` See: [Dnsmasq](/docs/guide-user/base-system/dhcp.dnsmasq#configuration "docs:guide-user:base-system:dhcp.dnsmasq") `/etc/ethers` See: [Dnsmasq](/docs/guide-user/base-system/dhcp.dnsmasq#configuration "docs:guide-user:base-system:dhcp.dnsmasq") `/etc/firewall.user` See: `Firewall` `/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf` See: `APC` `/etc/fstab` A [symlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symlink#POSIX_and_Unix-like_operating_systems "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symlink#POSIX_and_Unix-like_operating_systems") to `/tmp/fstab` which is being created and configured by UCI in `/etc/config/fstab`. `/etc/fw_env.config` See: [uboot.config](/docs/techref/bootloader/uboot.config "docs:techref:bootloader:uboot.config") `/etc/group` This is an ASCII file which defines the groups to which users belong to. `/etc/hosts` See: [Dnsmasq](/docs/guide-user/base-system/dhcp.dnsmasq#configuration "docs:guide-user:base-system:dhcp.dnsmasq") `/etc/hosts.allow` `/etc/hosts.deny` `/etc/hotplug.d` See: [Hotplug](/docs/guide-user/base-system/hotplug "docs:guide-user:base-system:hotplug") `/etc/init.d/rcS` Executed by [init](/docs/techref/process.boot#init "docs:techref:process.boot") every boot. `/etc/inittab` [inittab examples](http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/examples/inittab "http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/examples/inittab") `/etc/iproute2/rt_tables` Routing tables configuration. See: [iproute2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iproute2 "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iproute2") `/etc/mtab` [filesystems](/docs/techref/filesystems "docs:techref:filesystems"), [flash.layout](/docs/techref/flash.layout "docs:techref:flash.layout"), [procfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/procfs "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/procfs"), [sysfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sysfs "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sysfs"), [devpts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/devpts "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/devpts") `/etc/opkg.conf` See: [Opkg](/docs/guide-user/additional-software/opkg "docs:guide-user:additional-software:opkg") `/etc/passwd` `/etc/preinit` In OpenWrt the Kernel is executed by the [bootloader](/docs/techref/bootloader "docs:techref:bootloader") with the option `init=/etc/preinit` (instead of the usual `init=/sbin/init`). So the Kernel executes `/etc/preinit`. See: [process.boot](/docs/techref/process.boot "docs:techref:process.boot") `/etc/profile` `/etc/protocols` `/etc/rc.common` Part of the [Shebang (Unix)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang%20%28Unix%29 "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang (Unix)") of many shell scripts in `/etc/init.d`. It checks the start scripts for mistakes. E.g. since [R27797](https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/27797 "https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/27797") it checks whether *“start”* and *“stop”* are defined. `/etc/rc.local` This file gets executed by `/etc/rc.d/S95done` on every boot up. You should treat this file as a shell script. `/etc/resolv.conf` A symlink to `/tmp/resolv.conf`. `/etc/services` `/etc/shells` `/etc/sysctl.conf` `/etc/sysctl.conf` gets called every boot up by `/etc/rc.d/S99sysctl`. `/etc/sysupgrade.conf` This file contains files and directories that should be preserved during an upgrade. See: [Sysupgrade](/docs/techref/sysupgrade "docs:techref:sysupgrade") `/etc/TZ` A symlink to `/tmp/TZ` which is being created and configured with UCI in `/etc/config/system`
