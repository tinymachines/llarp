# LL-XS2510

The Luleey LL-XS2510 is a GPON/XPON SFP+ module, which in this context is used to connect to an FTTH provider, in this case DNS:NET from Germany. For the PPPoE Config see at [this post](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/network/wan/isp-configurations?do=#dnsnet "https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/network/wan/isp-configurations?do=#dnsnet").

### important instructions

To edit the SFP+ module, either a media converter must be used, or a fiber optic cable with a link must be connected to the module. Only then will the web interface start.

There are two different types of fiber optic cables:

1. UPC (Ultra Physical Contact) and
2. APC (Angled Physical Contact).

**UPC** : The ferrule (the pin sleeve that guides the fiber) has a straight grind with a slight convex curvature. This polish ensures that the fiber ends touch directly during connection and minimizes the air gap.

**APC** : The ferrule is beveled at an angle of 8 degrees, thereby minimizing return loss.

For the FTTH of the ISP DNS:NET, APC is required, specifically SC/APC to LC/APC connector, simplex 9/125Î¼m. It is normal that without a fiber optic cable and an active link, the information read out with ethtool does not correspond to that set in the web interface.

Note: The specifications for the sfp+ stick's speed are unclear. This may cause problems with modules with speeds between 1G and 10G. Please check the forums for your device. In my case, it's a Banana Pi R4 [https://forum.banana-pi.org/t/banana-bpi-r4-compatible-fiber-optic-module-with-isp-provider/19181/20](https://forum.banana-pi.org/t/banana-bpi-r4-compatible-fiber-optic-module-with-isp-provider/19181/20 "https://forum.banana-pi.org/t/banana-bpi-r4-compatible-fiber-optic-module-with-isp-provider/19181/20"). In my case i disabled Auto negotiation an set a fix speed of 1G [https://github.com/totkeks/SmartHome/blob/main/devices/router/openwrt/files/etc/hotplug.d/iface/10-sfp](https://github.com/totkeks/SmartHome/blob/main/devices/router/openwrt/files/etc/hotplug.d/iface/10-sfp "https://github.com/totkeks/SmartHome/blob/main/devices/router/openwrt/files/etc/hotplug.d/iface/10-sfp").

### Gathering the required information

Below, I describe where I read which information. I left all other fields unchanged. It's also likely that I entered too many parameters and the configuration would work with fewer modifications. I also plugged the GPON from the Fritz!Box into the BPI R4 and read the information from there.

- GPON SN: From the back of the Fritz!Box (modem ID) or from the web interface (PON serial number)
- Vendor ID: ethtool Fritz!Box GPON - Vendor Name
- Product Class: ethtool Fritz!Box GPON - Vendor PN (I think it is the same on all AVM SFP+)
- Device serial Number: ethtool Fritz!Box GPON - Vendor SN

### Configure SFP+ Module

To configure the module, you must access the web interface, either via a media converter or within the device. Please note the important instructions.

The web interface is located at: [http://192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1 "http://192.168.1.1")
