# IEEE 802.11s Mesh on OpenWrt

The Linux kernel began incorporating support for the IEEE 802.11s standard around 2008.  
OpenWrt began integrating the Linux kernel code for IEEE 802.11s shortly after the standard was officially released in 2011.

For full information about OpenWrt support, follow this link: [802-11s](/docs/guide-user/network/wifi/mesh/802-11s "docs:guide-user:network:wifi:mesh:802-11s")

## Verifying IEEE 802.11s Support on a Router

Apart from a few exceptions, most wireless drivers used by OpenWrt support 802.11s mesh.

Exceptions are Broadcom wireless chipsets and most usb wireless dongles.

Use the following to determine if your hardware supports 802.11s mesh.

```
iw list | grep "Supported interface modes" -A 9

...
      Supported interface modes:
                 * IBSS
                 * managed
                 * AP
                 * AP/VLAN
                 * WDS
                 * monitor
                 * mesh point
                 * P2P-client
		 * P2P-GO
...
```

Example: ath9k in router

```
iw list
...
valid interface combinations:
		 * #{ managed, WDS } <= 2048, #{ AP, mesh point } <= 8, #{ P2P-client, P2P-GO } <= 1, #{ IBSS } <= 1,
		   total <= 2048, #channels <= 1, STA/AP BI must match
		 * #{ IBSS, AP, mesh point } <= 1,
		   total <= 1, #channels <= 1, STA/AP BI must match, radar detect widths: { 20 MHz (no HT), 20 MHz }
...
```
