# Connect to ISP using L2TP with dual access

Many ISP's in Russia, Ukraine, Israel and other countries offer connection using [Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer%202%20Tunneling%20Protocol "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol"). In many cases ISP provides a “local” network, where internal resources of ISP are located (ftp, forums, etc.) Also users can exchange files through “local” network by P2P programs, like [Direct Connect](/docs/guide-user/services/dc/dc.overview "docs:guide-user:services:dc:dc.overview"). Traffic in “local” network is free or not limited by speed. This is called Dual Access. You may need to install the package [ppp-mod-pppol2tp](/packages/pkgdata/ppp-mod-pppol2tp "packages:pkgdata:ppp-mod-pppol2tp").
