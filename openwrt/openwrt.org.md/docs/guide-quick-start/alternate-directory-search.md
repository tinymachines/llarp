# OpenWrt Alternate Directory Search

If the Standard Flashing Instructions don't provide the information you're looking for, ask on the [Installation Category of the forum](https://forum.openwrt.org/c/installation "https://forum.openwrt.org/c/installation") or search the OpenWrt site for enough information about your device to find the proper OpenWrt firmware image. To do this:

- Find the *Device Page* for your device on the *OpenWrt Table of Hardware* at [https://openwrt.org/toh/start](https://openwrt.org/toh/start "https://openwrt.org/toh/start")
- Find the name and URL of the proper OpenWrt firmware image (factory or sysupgrade).
- Then go to [downloads.openwrt.org](https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/targets/ "https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/targets/") and find the OpenWrt image from the corresponding directory.
- Follow the flashing instructions on the *OpenWrt Device Page*, if needed.
