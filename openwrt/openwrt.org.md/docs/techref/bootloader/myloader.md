# MyLoader

MyLoader is the bootloader only seen so far on Compex wireless routers. If you have seen this bootloader on other devices that you own please add them to the bottom of the page. Unlike CFE or Redboot, MyLoader is a menu driven bootloader like the standard one on all adm5120 platforms by Edimax, Sweex and others. There are more details on the standard bootloader available on the midge website: [http://midge.vlad.org.ua](http://midge.vlad.org.ua "http://midge.vlad.org.ua")

The following data is for COMPEX WP54AG (non WRT version) and is probably valid also for COMPEX NP27G:

Images used for updating firmware consist of update header(offset 0) and system image(size+crc32+gziped kernel+cramfs; offset 0x100f8). After verifying update header, system image is saved to the first mtd partition (mtd1, memory address: 0x1fc00000). When booting, MyLoader verifies(crc) flash stored image, ungzips it and runs kernel....

firmware update image description:

```
address: size description
--------update header----------------------
0x00000: 4B  MAGIC (004d594c)
0x00004: 4B  CRC?? (unknown checksum, can be disabled by setting to 00000000)
0x00010: 8B  2xDEVICE ID
0x00050: 4B  size of system image (from 0x100f8)
-------system image------------------------
0x100f8: 4B  size of gzipped kernel+cramfs
0x100fc: 4B  crc32 of gzipped kernel+cramfs (from 0x10100 to eof)
0x10100: n/a gziped linux kernel + cramfs filesystem
```

(note: there is a lot of another data in update header, but you have to modify only size (0x50) and disable checksum (0x4) to load modified system image)

Below is a set of instructions which can be used to update the bootloader to CFE using the bundle provided for the WP54-WRT. I have tried this on my WP54G-1D but after a few seconds the board freezes (EDIT: this is probably because CFE for WP54-WRT checks for “security device” attached to GPIO0, GPIO1 and will not run on non WRT versions of WP54). Also JTAG seems to be a bit odd on these boxes, and as yet I have to get some sensible looking results from it.

Please select :
```

As you can see I have pre-broken my image, MyLoader checks the whole image against a CRC before booting. At this point you can select 5, Update Flash which opens a new menu.

```
Update Flash (Binary Mode)
1 - Update BIOS
2 - Update System Paramters
3 - Update Board Paramters
4 - Update Partition Table
5 - Update Partition
Please select : 
```

Then select 1 - Update BIOS. You can send any binary file, and it will just overwrite the bootloader.**Warning -- This will toast your router if you send a bad file.**

```
Update BIOS

Usage (Windows 2000/XP) :
  tftp -i 192.168.168.1 put 
```

You then TFTP your file to the router and given any luck you should see:

```

Escape out of that menu:

```

2 - Load Program
3 - BIOS Setup
4 - Fdisk Utility
5 - Update Flash (Binary Mode)
6 - Update Firmware (Image Mode)
7 - Reboot System
Please select :
```

Then select 7. This is the point of no return. If you were sensible enough to save a copy of the previous images then continue at your leasure.

At which point I can enter commands for a few seconds, but after that it freezes for me.

## Myloram

Special bootloader for Compex, designed to restore the router via JTAG. This bootloader is loaded into memory after the initialization of the processor with using special commands sent. It allows to exclude interference with the device hardware by unsoldering flash memory. After booting bootloader, you can see a similar menu as the original MyLoader. Also bootloader Myloram for [COMPEX WPE72(Atheros AR724x)](http://www.cpx.cz/dls/wpe72_WPE72NX_MMJ5N26E/wp72_loader_jtag.zip "http://www.cpx.cz/dls/wpe72_WPE72NX_MMJ5N26E/wp72_loader_jtag.zip") are tested on a third-party device TP-Link (only with same processor) and successfully restored.

And not tested [COMPEX WP543(Atheros AR71xx)](http://www.cpx.cz/dls/JTAG%20SW_CONFIG_INSTR/ "http://www.cpx.cz/dls/JTAG%20SW_CONFIG_INSTR/").

**Note:** Unlike the original [COMPEX instruction](http://www.cpx.cz/dls/JTAG%20SW_CONFIG_INSTR/How%20to%20JTAG%20to%20Compex%20Loader.pdf "http://www.cpx.cz/dls/JTAG%20SW_CONFIG_INSTR/How%20to%20JTAG%20to%20Compex%20Loader.pdf") (or macro file for OCD Commander) for recovering bootloader via JTAG, to third-party devices, loaded with the address of the memory must be set explicitly.

For example in OCD Commander:

```
...
download myloram.srec
go 0x81F00000
```

Or if using OpenOCD:

```
...
load_image myloram.srec 0x81F00000
resume 0x81F00000
```
