# BusyBox

[BusyBox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusyBox "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusyBox") is used for several system utilities in OpenWrt like `ash` shell, `cp`, `ls`, `echo`, `ping` and many others. It provides tiny replacements with fewer options for most of the utilities from [GNU Core Utilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU%20Core%20Utilities "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU Core Utilities"), [GNU Inetutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils/ "https://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils/") and other essential tools like `gzip`.

All this utilities are compiled as “applets” into a single binary file `/bin/busybox`.

## Identify OpenWrt version through udhcp

When an OpenWrt system tries to obtain an IP using DHCP on its WAN interface, it adds a Vendor-Class option that contains the Busybox version:

`Vendor-Class Option 60, length 12: “udhcp 1.28.3”`

This can be used to estimate which OpenWrt version is running on a router if you don't have access to the router itself.
