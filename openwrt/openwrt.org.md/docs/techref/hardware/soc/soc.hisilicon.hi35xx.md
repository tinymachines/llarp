# Hisilicon hi35xx

This page covers devices based on HiSilicon HI35xx SoC’s. Mostly these devices are IP cameras. Work is done under the [OpenIPC](https://openipc.org/ "https://openipc.org/") project, which is based on the source code of the OpenWRT project.

# Why use OpenIPC?

- **Privacy:** as the code is open you can be sure that there are no hidden functions leaking your private information elsewhere.
- **Security:** standard installation is secure by default, no backdoors or poor passwords.
- **Long term package support:** standard modular packages provide long term support even for old IP cameras.
- **Performance and Stability:** OpenIPC firmware is made of standardized modules used in all supported devices. This means each module will likely receive more testing and bug fixing than stock firmware which can be tweaked for each product line and never touched again.
- **Extensibility:** OpenIPC provides many capabilities found only in high-end devices. Many application packages are standardized, so you can easily build the solution you need: connect to HomeAssistant, add I2C sensor or make a standalone field device with solar panel, battery power and a Wifi/GSM module.
- **Community Support:** You can interact directly with developers, volunteers managing the software modules and with other long-time OpenIPC users, drastically increasing the chances you will solve the issue at hand.
- **No additional cost:** OpenIPC is provided without any monetary cost. It has been entirely created by a team of volunteers: developers and maintainers, individuals and companies. If you enjoy using OpenIPC, consider contributing some effort to help us improve it for others!
