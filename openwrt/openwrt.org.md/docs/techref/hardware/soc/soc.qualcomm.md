### Not supported

Qualcomm MSM SoC, used in some Mobile Travel Routers is not supported, because Linux support was removed in [March 2015](http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/arch/arm/mach-msm?id=c0c89fafa289ea241ba3fb22d6f583f8089a719e "http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/arch/arm/mach-msm?id=c0c89fafa289ea241ba3fb22d6f583f8089a719e").
