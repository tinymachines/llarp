mips\_24kc stands for

- mips: [The official MIPS company](https://www.mips.com/ "https://www.mips.com/")
- 24kc: The 24Kc is a 32-bit RISC core for high performance applications

## General introduction

The 24K core family product line variants started shipping in fiscal 2004 and has become one of the most successful core families in MIPS's history with more than 50 licensee companies to date.  
The 24K product line is based on a very efficient 8-stage pipeline that delivers excellent single-threaded performance at optimized area and power footprints.  
The 24KE line leverages the high-performance 24K microarchitecture and efficiently adds Digital Signal Processing (DSP) functionality while the 24KE Pro product line adds to the 24KE a flexible co-processor interface that allows designers to include custom, value-add functions to their SoC.  
The 24K core family has been licensed to notable companies including Atheros (acquired by Qualcomm), Broadcom, BroadLight, Cisco Systems, Lantiq, Ralink, Realtek, Sigma Designs, Renesas Electronics, Trident Microsystems, Toshiba and others.
