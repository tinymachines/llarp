# powerpc\_464fp

The 464 core is an enhanced version of the 440 core. To enhance overall throughput, the PowerPC 464 super - scalar core incorporates a 7-stage pipe - line and executes up to two instructions per cycle. Its large 32 KB data cache and 32 KB instruction cache are 64-way set-associative. For additional system performance, the PowerPC 464 core includes dynamic branch prediction and 24 digital signal processing (DSP) instructions, as well as non-blocking caches that can be managed in either write-through or write-back mode.
