## Description

The 24K® core from MIPS Technologies is a high-performance, low-power, 32-bit MIPS® RISC processor core family intended for custom system-on-silicon applications. The core is designed for semiconductor manufacturing companies, ASIC developers, and system OEMs who want to rapidly integrate their own custom logic and peripher- als with a high-performance RISC processor. A 24K core is fully synthesizable to allow maximum flexibility; it is highly portable across processes and can easily be integrated into full system-on-silicon designs. This allows develop- ers to focus their attention on end-user specific characteristics of their product
