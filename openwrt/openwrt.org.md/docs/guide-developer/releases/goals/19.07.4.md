# Release goals for 19.07.4

## About this page

This page lists “release goals” that are expected to be met before OpenWrt 19.07.4 can be released.

Information on this page is indicative. There is no guarantee that the actual release will include all goals, or that the release will be done when all goals listed here are met.

**Type** can be:

- **Feature:** something we would like to add before the release
- **Regression:** something that was known to be working but got broken recently. Please fill “Broken since” accordingly. Should only be used for “recent” regressions (e.g. broken since 19.07.X for a 19.07.Y release with Y &gt; X)
- **Bug:** serious bug that should be fixed before releasing
- **Security:** a special type of regression or bug related to security. Only add if the issue can be made public.

**Status:** OK if the feature/fix is committed, WIP if somebody is working on it, TODO otherwise
