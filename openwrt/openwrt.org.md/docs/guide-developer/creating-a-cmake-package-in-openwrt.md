# Create a Cmake package in OpenWrt

In the [Meson tutorial](/docs/guide-developer/creating_a_meson_based_package "docs:guide-developer:creating_a_meson_based_package"), we learned how to create a Meson package with a detailed guide. Since Cmake and Meson have similar roots, this tutorial will only focus on their differences.

## CMakeLists.txt

To begin, let's create a CMake project. The `main.c` file for this project will be the same as the one in the Meson tutorial, which includes a single `“Hello, World”` program. However, in order to use CMake, we need to include a `CMakeLists.txt` file. The most basic CMake file is presented here for simplicity.

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1...3.27)
 
project(
  hellocmake
  VERSION 1.0
  LANGUAGES C)
 
add_executable(hellocmake main.c)
install(TARGETS hellocmake DESTINATION /usr/bin)
```

## Makefile

The `Makefile` is very similar to other OpenWrt-based makefiles. The only difference is that it includes `cmake.mk` instead of `meson.mk`:

```
include $(TOPDIR)/rules.mk
 
PKG_NAME:=hellocmake
PKG_VERSION:=0.1
PKG_RELEASE:=1
 
SOURCE_DIR:=/media/workspace/packages/cmakepackages/hellocmake
PKG_BUILD_DIR:=$(BUILD_DIR)/hellocmake-$(PKG_VERSION)
 
include $(INCLUDE_DIR)/package.mk
include $(INCLUDE_DIR)/cmake.mk
 
define Package/hellocmake
	CATEGORY:=custom
	TITLE:=Simple Cmake package
	#DEPENDS:=+libstdcpp +ixwebsocket +libatomic
endef
 
define Package/hellocmake/description
	hellocmake is a simple application to demonstrate OpenWrt build system with cmake packages
endef
 
define Package/hellocmake/install	
	$(INSTALL_DIR) $(1)/usr/bin
	$(INSTALL_BIN) $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/hellocmake $(1)/usr/bin/
endef
 
$(eval $(call BuildPackage,hellocmake))
```

## Passing Cmake options

In order to pass `Cmake` options, we can use the following syntax in the `Makefile`

```
CMAKE_OPTIONS+= \
	-D<OPTION>bool=OFF
```

For example:

```
CMAKE_OPTIONS+= \
	-DBUILD_TESTING:bool=OFF
```

## Build

To enable this package, open the configuration menu by typing `make menuconfig` in the command line. From there, go to `custom` → `hellocmake` and select the package.

If everything goes smoothly, the package that is built will be located in `<BIN_DIR>/packages/<target>/cmakepackages/`.

For instance:

```
hellocmake_0.1-1_arm_cortex-a7_neon-vfpv4.ipk
```
