# High-level security incident response handling process

The goal of this high-level process is to identify what needs to be done for a security response, and who can help making it happen.

**1. Awareness** Task Duration Who can do it Notes [Make security team aware](/docs/guide-developer/security#vulnerability_reporting "docs:guide-developer:security") - Whoever being aware about security issue Its important to handle the issue properly from the beginning. **2. Identification** Task Duration Who can do it Notes Analyze report - Security response team Assess incoming reports for validity and potential severity. **3. Assesment** Task Duration Who can do it Notes Impact evaluation - Security response team Determine the potential impact on users and the project (e.g., data exposure, remote code execution). Risk categorization - Security response team Assign severity levels (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) using frameworks like CVSS. Confirm the issue - Security response team Reproduce the issue in a controlled environment to confirm its validity. **4. Containment** Task Duration Who can do it Notes Prevent further exploitation - - Take immediate action to limit the incidentâ€™s impact (e.g., temporarily disabling a vulnerable feature, service) Communicate internally - Security response team Notify relevant maintainers, sysadmins to coordinate the response **5. Remediation** Task Duration Who can do it Notes Fix the vulnerability - - Patch the issue in the codebase and thoroughly test the fix Backport fixes - - Apply fixes to older supported versions, if necessary **6. Disclosure** Task Duration Who can do it Notes Communicate with reporter - Security response team Notify the reporter of the fix and thank them for their contribution. Submit CVE - Security response team If applicable, request a CVE ID for tracking and disclosure Publish security advisory on wiki - Security response team Use [previous advisories](/advisory/start "advisory:start") as template Publish advisory to mailing list - Security response team Use [previous emails](https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-announce/2022-October/thread.html "https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-announce/2022-October/thread.html") as template, **GPG sign** email! Publish advisory on forum - Security response team Use [previous posts](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/security-advisory-2022-10-04-1-wolfssl-buffer-overflow-during-a-tls-1-3-handshake-cve-2022-39173/138880 "https://forum.openwrt.org/t/security-advisory-2022-10-04-1-wolfssl-buffer-overflow-during-a-tls-1-3-handshake-cve-2022-39173/138880") as template, probably makes sense always for remotely exploitable or critical vulnerabilities.
