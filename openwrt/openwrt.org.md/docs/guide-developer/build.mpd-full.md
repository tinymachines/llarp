# MPD-full building from source

More information about building from source: [OpenWrt Buildroot - Usage](/docs/guide-developer/toolchain/start "docs:guide-developer:toolchain:start")

Based on the following reference:  
[Help on compiling MPD full](https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=158385#p158385 "https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=158385#p158385")

If you build from source you will only be able to select the MPD-mini from the make menuconfig interface.  
To display and enable the full version in the menuconfig interface, you'll have to edit the MPD Makefile.

### Barrier Breaker and Chaos Calmer

1. In your git clone directory edit `/openwrt/feeds/packages/sound/mpd/Makefile`.  
   It is a good idea to make a backup copy before starting.
2. Detect the area in the Makefile involved with the full MPD installation and edit `+libffmpeg` to `+libffmpeg-full`
3. Save the file

Orignal file:

```
  TITLE+= (full)
  DEPENDS+= \
   +AUDIO_SUPPORT:alsa-lib \
   +libaudiofile +BUILD_PATENTED:libfaad2 +libffmpeg +libid3tag \
   +libmms +libogg +libsndfile +libvorbis
  PROVIDES:=mpd
  VARIANT:=full
```

Edited file:

```
  TITLE+= (full)
  DEPENDS+= \
   +AUDIO_SUPPORT:alsa-lib \
   +libaudiofile +BUILD_PATENTED:libfaad2 +libffmpeg-full +libid3tag \
   [+libmms +libogg +libsndfile +libvorbis 
  PROVIDES:=mpd
  VARIANT:=full
```

Now if you start `make menuconfig`, you'll have the choice to build the full or the mini MPD version
