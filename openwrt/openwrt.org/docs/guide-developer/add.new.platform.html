<p>
Linux is now one of the most widespread operating system for embedded devices due to its openess as well as the wide variety of platforms it can run on.
Many manufacturer actually use it in firmware you can find on many devices: DVB-T decoders, routers, print servers, DVD players ...
Most of the time the stock firmware is not really open to the consumer, even if it uses open source software.
</p>

<p>
You might be interested in running a Linux based firmware for your router for various reasons: extending the use of a network protocol (such as <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr>),
having new features, new piece of software inside, or for security reasons. A fully open-source firmware is de-facto needed for such applications,
since you want to be free to use this or that version of a particular reason, be able to correct a particular bug. Few manufacturers do ship their
routers with a Sample Development Kit, that would allow you to create your own and custom firmware and most of the time, when they do, you will
most likely not be able to complete the firmware creation process.
</p>

<p>
This is one of the reasons why OpenWrt and other firmware exists: providing a version independent, and tools independent firmware, that can be run
on various platforms, known to be running Linux originally.

The <em>nmap</em> utility is able to report whether your device uses a Linux <abbr title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</abbr>/<abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> stack, and if so, will show you which Linux kernel
version is probably runs. This report is quite reliable and it can make the distinction between BSD and Linux <abbr title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</abbr>/<abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> stacks and others.
</p>

<p>
Using the same tool, you can also do port scanning and service version discovery. For instance, the following command will report which
<abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr>-based services are running on the device, and which version of the service is being used:

In conformance to the GPL license, you have to release the following sources:

 * complete toolchain that made the kernel and applications be compiled (gcc, binutils, libc)
 * tools to build a custom firmware (mksquashfs, mkcramfs ...)
 * kernel sources with patches to make it run on this specific hardware, this does not include binary drivers

Once the SDK is available, you are most likely not to be able to build a complete or functional firmware using it, but parts of it, like
only the kernel, or only the root filesystem. Most manufacturers do not really care releasing a tool that do work every time you uncompress
and use it.

Most of the time, the kernel source that comes along with the SDK is not really clean, and is not a standard Linux version, it also has
architecture specific fixes backported from the CVS or the git repository of the kernel development trees. Anyway, some parts can be easily
isolated and used as a good start to make a vanilla kernel work your hardware.
</p>

<p>
Some directories are very likely to have local modifications needed to make your hardware be recognized and used under Linux. First of all,
you need to find out the linux kernel version that is used by your hardware, this can be found by editing the linux/Makefile file.

<p>
So now, you know that you have to download a standard kernel tarball at kernel.org that matches the version being used by your hardware.
</p>

<p>
Then you can create a diff file between the two trees, especially for the following directories:
</p>
<div class="table sectionedit19"><table class="inline">
	<tr class="row0">

<p>
This will constitute a basic set of three patches that are very likely to contain any needed modifications that has been made to the stock
Linux kernel to run on your specific device. Of course, the content produced by the diff -urN may not always be relevant, so that you have
to clean up those patches to only let the “must have” code into them.
</p>

<p>
The first patch will contain all the code that is needed by the board to be initialized at startup, as well as processor detection and other
boot time specific fixes.
</p>

<p>
The second patch will contain all useful definitions for that board: addresses, kernel granularity, redefinitions, processor family and
features ...
</p>

<p>
The third patch may contain drivers for: serial console, ethernet NIC, wireless NIC, USB NIC ... Most of the time this patch contains nothing
else than “glue” code that has been added to make the binary driver work with the Linux kernel. This code might not be useful if you plan on
writing drivers from scratch for this hardware.

<p>
The <a href="/docs/techref/bootloader" class="wikilink1" title="docs:techref:bootloader" data-wiki-id="docs:techref:bootloader">bootloader</a> is the first program that is started right after your device has been powered on. This program, can be more or less sophisticated,
some do let you do network booting, USB mass storage booting ... The bootloader is device and architecture specific, some bootloaders were
designed to be universal such as RedBoot or <a href="/docs/techref/bootloader/uboot" class="wikilink1" title="docs:techref:bootloader:uboot" data-wiki-id="docs:techref:bootloader:uboot">Das U-Boot</a> so that you can meet those loaders on totally different platforms and expect them to behave the same way.
</p>

<p>
If your device runs a proprietary operating system, you are very likely to deal with a proprietary boot loader as well. This may not always be a
limitation, some proprietary bootloaders can even have source code available (i.e : Broadcom CFE).
</p>

<p>
According to the bootloader features, hacking on the device will be more or less easier. It is very probable that the bootloader, even exotic and rare, has a documentation somewhere over the Internet. In order to know what will be possible with your bootloader and the way you are going to hack the device, look over the following features:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> does the bootloader allow <a href="/inbox/howto/netboot" class="wikilink1" title="inbox:howto:netboot" data-wiki-id="inbox:howto:netboot">net booting</a> via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap Protocol" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap Protocol">BOOTP</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot Execution Environment" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot Execution Environment">PXE</a>/<abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr>/NFS or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial File Transfer Protocol" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial File Transfer Protocol">TFTP</a>?</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> does the bootloader accept loading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable and Linkable Format" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable and Linkable Format">ELF</a> binaries?</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> does the bootloader have a kernel/firmware size limitation?</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> does the bootloader expect some magic values to be part of the firmware, or the firmware to be encrypted?</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> does the bootloader expect a firmware format to be loaded with?</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> are the loaded files executed from RAM or flash?</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Net booting is something very convenient, because you will only have to set up network booting servers on your development station, and keep the
original firmware on the device till you are sure you can replace it. This also prevents your device from being flashed, and potentially bricked
every time you want to test a modification on the kernel/filesystem.
</p>

<p>
If your device needs to be flashed every time you load a firmware, the bootlader might only accept a specific firmware format to be loaded, so
that you will have to understand the firmware format as well.

<h3 class="sectionedit21" id="making_binary_drivers_work">Making binary drivers work</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
As we have explained before, manufacturers do release binary drivers in their <abbr title="GNU General Public License">GPL</abbr> tarball. When those drivers are statically linked into the
kernel, they become <abbr title="GNU General Public License">GPL</abbr> as well, fortunately or unfortunately, most of the drivers are not statically linked. This anyway lets you a chance to
dynamically link the driver with the current kernel version, and try to make them work together.
</p>

<p>
This is one of the most tricky and grey part of the fully open source projects. Some drivers require few modifications to be working with your
custom kernel, because they worked with an earlier kernel, and few modifications have been made to the kernel in-between those versions.
This is for instance the case with the binary driver of the Broadcom BCM43xx Wireless Chipsets, where only few differences were made to the
network interface structures.

<p>
Most of the time, loading binary drivers will fail, and generate a kernel oops. You can know the last symbol the binary drivers attempted to
use, and see in the kernel headers file, if you do not have to move some structures field before or after that symbol in order to keep compatibily
with both the binary driver and the stock kernel drivers.

<div class="level3">

<p>
You might want to understand the firmware format, even if you are not yet capable of running a custom firmware on your device, because this is
sometimes a blocking part of the flashing process.
</p>

<p>
A firmware format is most of the time composed of the following fields:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> header, containing a firmware version and additional fields: Vendor, Hardware version ...</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> CRC32 checksum on either the whole file or just part of it</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Binary and/or compressed kernel image</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Binary and/or compressed root filesystem image</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> potential garbage</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once you have figured out how the firmware format is partitioned, you will have to write your own tool that produces valid firmware binaries.
One thing to be very careful here is the endianness of either the machine that produces the binary firmware and the device that will be flashed
using this binary firmware.

<h3 class="sectionedit23" id="writing_a_flash_map_driver">Writing a flash map driver</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
The flash map driver has an important role in making your custom firmware work because it is responsible of mapping the correct flash regions and
associated rights to specific parts of the system such as: bootloader, kernel, user filesystem.
</p>

<p>
Writing your own flash map driver is not really a hard task once you know how your firmware image and flash is structured. You will find below a
commented example that covers the case of the device where the bootloader can pass to the kernel its partition plan.
</p>

<p>
First of all, you need to make your flash map driver be visible in the kernel configuration options, this can be done by editing the file
<code>linux/drivers/mtd/maps/Kconfig</code>:
</p>
<div class="table sectionedit24"><table class="inline">
	<tr class="row0">
		<td class="col0"> <pre class="code">config MTD_DEVICE_FLASH  
        tristate &quot;Device Flash device&quot;  
        depends on ARCHITECTURE &amp;&amp; DEVICE  
        help  
         Flash memory access on DEVICE boards. Currently only works with  
         Bootloader Foo and Bootloader Bar.</pre>

</table></div>
<!-- EDIT{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;table&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hid&quot;:&quot;table6&quot;,&quot;secid&quot;:24,&quot;range&quot;:&quot;17382-17643&quot;} -->
<p>
Then add your source file to the linux/drivers/mtd/maps/Makefile, so that it will be compiled along with the kernel.
</p>
<div class="table sectionedit25"><table class="inline">
	<tr class="row0">
		<td class="col0"> <code>obj-$(CONFIG_MTD_DEVICE_FLASH)      += device-flash.o</code> </td>
	</tr>

<!-- EDIT{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;table&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hid&quot;:&quot;table7&quot;,&quot;secid&quot;:25,&quot;range&quot;:&quot;17762-17823&quot;} -->
<p>
You can then write the kernel driver itself, by creating a <code>linux/drivers/mtd/maps/device-flash.c</code> C source file.
