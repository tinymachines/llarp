# Sending patches by git send-email

Send an email to the [development mailing list](https://lists.openwrt.org/mailman/listinfo/openwrt-devel "https://lists.openwrt.org/mailman/listinfo/openwrt-devel"). All patches need to be sent in the same format as those that are listed on [patchwork](https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/openwrt/list/ "https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/openwrt/list/"). If the patch does not get listed in patchwork then it won't get processed.

Using [git send-email](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email "https://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email") is warmly recommended, as email clients tend to add spaces and screw up the formatting or add non-printable characters.

```
git send-email --from=youremail@example.com --to="openwrt-devel@lists.openwrt.org" 001-description.patch
```
