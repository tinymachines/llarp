# UPnP (Universal Plug and Play)

- Please take the time, figure out what devices need port redirects (most do not), and manually configure [firewall redirect rules](/docs/guide-user/firewall/fw3_configurations/fw3_config_examples "docs:guide-user:firewall:fw3_configurations:fw3_config_examples").
  
  - Specific ports for devices/services which need redirects can either be found on the device’s/service’s website or [PortForward.com](https://portforward.com "https://portforward.com")
