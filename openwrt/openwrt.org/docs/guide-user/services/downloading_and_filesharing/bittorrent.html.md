It can be configured via LuCi web interface app and it comes with its own web GUI for URI downloadings transmission-daemon 2.40-1 libcurl, libopenssl, libpthread, libevent2, librt 182.225 [Transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission%20%28BitTorrent%20client%29 "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission (BitTorrent client)") is a simple BitTorrent client. It features a very simple, intuitive interface on top on an efficient, cross-platform back-end. This package contains the daemon itself.  
See â†’`/etc/config/transmission` to configure it transmission-remote 2.40-1 189.729 CLI remote interface for transmission. transmission-cli 2.40-1 transmission-daemon 709.887 CLI utilities for transmission. transmission-web 2.40-1 transmission-daemon 138.156 Webinterface resources for transmission. rtorrent 0.9.8-2 libc, libcurl4, libncurses6, libpthread, libopenssl1.1, libstdcpp6, zlib 562.281 [rTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rTorrent "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rTorrent") is a BitTorrent client for ncurses, using the [LibTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibTorrent "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibTorrent") library. The client and library is written in C + + with emphasis on speed and efficiency, while delivering equivalent features to those found in GUI based clients in an ncurses client. rtorrent-rpc 0.9.8-2 libc, libcurl4, libncurses6, libpthread, libopenssl1.1, libstdcpp6, zlib, xmlrpc-c-server 558.708 [rTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rTorrent "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rTorrent") is a BitTorrent client for ncurses, also has a built-in daemon mode, clients can control it via [XML-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC"). LuCI based client: [luci-app-rtorrent](https://github.com/wolandmaster/luci-app-rtorrent "https://github.com/wolandmaster/luci-app-rtorrent") ctorrent dnh3.3.2-5 uclibcxx, libopenssl 86.767 [CTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTorrent "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTorrent") is a BitTorrent client written in the C programming language, known to be a very robust and mature programming language, which produces fast and optimized application. This package is built with OpenSSL support. ctorrent-nossl dnh3.3.2-5 uclibcxx 86.720 CTorrent is a BitTorrent client written in the C programming language, known to be a very robust and mature programming language, which produces fast and optimized application. This package is built with builtin (Steve Reid's public-domain) SHA-1 support deluge* [Deluge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluge%20%28software%29 "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluge (software)") is written in Python and should be available since [R20178](https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/20178 "https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/20178").  
Deluge is broken in OpenWrt: [6888](https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6888 "https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6888") deluge needs rblibtorrent, which is broken and won't probably be fixed anytime soon  
[https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/packages/net/deluge](https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/packages/net/deluge "https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/packages/net/deluge") btpd 0.16-2 BTPD is a bittorrent client consisting of a daemon and client commands, which can be used to read and/or manipulate the daemon state. The daemon is capable of running several torrents simultaneously and only uses one tcp port. It's fairly low on resource usage and should be perfect for file distribution sites. Efficient downloads and ease of use makes this client a good choice for the casual user as well.
