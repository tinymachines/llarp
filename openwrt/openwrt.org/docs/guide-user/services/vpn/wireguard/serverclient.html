<p>
WireGuard creates a point-to-point <abbr title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</abbr> between two or more peers/endpoints.
The protocol itself treats all peers equally, so in theory there is nothing that distinguishes a server from a client.
In practice however, it often degrades to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client–server_model" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client–server_model">client-server</a> model due to <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 4">IPv4</abbr> and <abbr title="Network Address Translation">NAT</abbr> connectivity limitations and gateway firewall restrictions.
Thus, one of the peers typically needs to take the server role with a public <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address, a statically configured <abbr title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</abbr> port and a port opening firewall rule.
The other peers can take the client roles with private <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses, dynamic <abbr title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</abbr> ports and don&#039;t need port opening firewall rules.

<div class="level2">

<p>
A <abbr title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</abbr> server listens for a connection initiated by another host/device/service.
Your OpenWrt router acts as a server when you install WireGuard to enable remote administration and/or remote access to network services on your <abbr title="Local Area Network">LAN</abbr>.
Your WireGuard server at home can also provide a measure of security when on public networks or bypass geo-restrictions when traveling since your traffic is encrypted through a tunnel to your server and then appears to be originating from your home.
A commercial <abbr title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</abbr> provider&#039;s WireGuard peer would be considered a server as well.

<h2 class="sectionedit3" id="vpn_client">VPN client</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
A <abbr title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</abbr> client initiates a connection to another peer.
Your computer or mobile device acts as a client when it connects back to your OpenWrt router as a WireGuard endpoint from outside.
Alternatively, if you configure your OpenWrt router to connect to a commercial <abbr title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</abbr> service, then the OpenWrt peer itself may be considered a client.

<h2 class="sectionedit4" id="site-to-site">Site-to-site</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
WireGuard can create a site-to-site tunnel between two or more separate networks such that they act as one.
Here, either or both sides may initiate a connection, and both sides listen for that data.
This lets you administer and/or share network resources between the two networks.
A common use case for this scenario is linking two remote office networks together.
