## Introduction

geoip-shell restricts access from the Internet based on the geographical location. It is a useful security tool for those who do self-hosting or enable port forwarding from WAN to a LAN host for any reason.

geoip-shell is lightweight and efficient, easy to set up and requires zero maintenance.

geoip-shell supports both new (nftables-based) and older (iptables-based) OpenWrt versions.
