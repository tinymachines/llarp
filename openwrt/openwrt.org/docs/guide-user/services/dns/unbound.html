<a href="https://www.unbound.net/" class="urlextern" title="https://www.unbound.net/" rel="ugc nofollow">Unbound</a> is a validating, recursive, and caching <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> resolver. The C implementation of Unbound is developed and maintained by <a href="https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/" class="urlextern" title="https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/" rel="ugc nofollow">NLnet Labs</a>.

<p>
OpenWrt base install uses Dnsmasq for <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> forwarding (and <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr> serving). This works well for many cases. Dependence on the upstream resolver can be cause for concern. It is often provided by the <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr>, and some users have switched to public <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> providers. Either way can result in problems due to performance, hijacking, trustworthiness, or several other reasons. Running a recursive resolver is a solution.

Releases <a href="/releases/17.01/start" class="wikilink1" title="releases:17.01:start" data-wiki-id="releases:17.01:start">LEDE 17.01</a> and <a href="/releases/18.06/start" class="wikilink1" title="releases:18.06:start" data-wiki-id="releases:18.06:start">OpenWrt 18.06</a> have included UCI/LuCI for the Unbound <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages" class="urlextern" title="https://github.com/openwrt/packages" rel="ugc nofollow">package</a> and complete documentation in its README.
The UCI/LuCI features should be familiar to those that have tweaked dnsmasq in the past.
“How To” are available for integration with either dnsmasq or odhcpd.
“How To” are available to configure Unbound as forwarding client of <abbr title="DNS over TLS">DoT</abbr>.
</p>

<p>
<abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> over <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> is fully supported with Unbound configuration helpers in UCI and LuCI. <strong>You should be able to find it all in the README.</strong> You can manage zone recursion, zone forward, and zone transfer preferences. These are present in a form similar to how the firewall pin point rules work. You may forward specific domains to specific <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> servers with or without <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr>. This may be useful where you need location specific resolution for <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr> colocated services such as is often done by Google (<a href="http://www.youtube.com" class="urlextern" title="http://www.youtube.com" rel="ugc nofollow">www.youtube.com</a> by 8.8.8.8), but wish to have a private <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> like CloudFlare (1.1.1.1) mask location while resolving general look-ups.
