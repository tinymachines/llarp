<div class="level1">

<p>
If you have forgotten the root password or if the root password no longer works, you have to use the <a href="/docs/guide-user/troubleshooting/failsafe_and_factory_reset" class="wikilink1" title="docs:guide-user:troubleshooting:failsafe_and_factory_reset" data-wiki-id="docs:guide-user:troubleshooting:failsafe_and_factory_reset">Failsafe Mode and Factory Reset</a>.
</p>

<p>
From there, you don&#039;t have to reset the whole configuration.
Note that fail safe mode does not require a password for authentication of root (!)
</p>

<p>
You only have to mount the root file system and set a new password with <code>passwd</code> and then trigger a restart. In fail safe mode, <code>passwd</code> will not ask for the old password (that you may have forgotten):
</p>
<pre class="code">root@(none):~# mount_root
switching to jffs2 overlay
root@(none):/rom/root# passwd
Changing password for root
New password:
Retype password:
passwd: password for root changed by root
root@(none):/rom/root# reboot -f</pre>

</div>
