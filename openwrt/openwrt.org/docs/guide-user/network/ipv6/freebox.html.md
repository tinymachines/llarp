For *Freebox Crystal* see [How to use OpenWrt behind a Freebox Crystal with IPv6 bridge](/docs/guide-user/network/ipv6/freeboxcrystal "docs:guide-user:network:ipv6:freeboxcrystal").

This HOWTO explains how to configure OpenWrt to:

- Enable IPv6 on the Freebox.
- Obtain IPv6 public network delegation in OpenWrt.
- Filter IPv6 incoming traffic.

The Freebox is a popular Internet router delivered by [French ISP Free](https://Free.fr "https://Free.fr") to its customers.
