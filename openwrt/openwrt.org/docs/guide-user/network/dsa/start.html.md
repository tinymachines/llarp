# DSA Networking

Starting in OpenWrt 21.02, many target architectures have switched from swconfig to DSA [(Distributed Switch Architecture)](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/dsa/dsa.html "https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/dsa/dsa.html"), the Linux kernel subsystem for network switches. DSA configuration is incompatible with swconfig.

See the links below to learn more about using OpenWrt and DSA.
