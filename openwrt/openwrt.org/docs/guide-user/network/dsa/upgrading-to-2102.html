<p>
OpenWrt 21.02.0 has <a href="/releases/21.02/notes-21.02.0#highlights_in_openwrt_21020" class="wikilink1" title="releases:21.02:notes-21.02.0" data-wiki-id="releases:21.02:notes-21.02.0">many important features</a> that make it worthwhile (or even important!) to upgrade to this new version. Before you upgrade, you should be aware of a number of criteria:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> OpenWrt 21.02.0 requires <strong>8 <abbr title="Megabyte">MB</abbr> Flash/64 <abbr title="Megabyte">MB</abbr> RAM.</strong> To see if your device can support 21.02.0, enter your device&#039;s brand/model in the table below and check the <strong>Flash</strong> and <strong>RAM</strong> columns.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Direct sysupgrade from 18.06 (or earlier) to 21.02 is <strong>not</strong> supported. To upgrade, you should backup your configuration, install 21.02.0, and then manually re-create your configuration.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>As always, make a backup of your configuration before proceeding.</em></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If your router currently runs 19.07, in many cases, you can upgrade to 21.02.0 using either the LuCI web <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> (keeping configuration) or sysupgrade from the command line. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> However, there is no “keep-configuration” migration path from 19.07 to 21.02 for targets that <a href="/releases/21.02/notes-21.02.0#initial_dsa_support" class="wikilink1" title="releases:21.02:notes-21.02.0" data-wiki-id="releases:21.02:notes-21.02.0">switched from swconfig to DSA.</a> The affected targets are: <strong>ath79 (only TP-Link TL-WR941ND), bcm4908, gemini, kirkwood, mediatek (most boards), mvebu, octeon, ramips (mt7621 subtarget only)</strong>, and <strong>realtek</strong>. Check the <strong>Target</strong> column in the table below. If your device is listed, check its <strong>Device Page</strong> (link in the table below) or <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org" class="urlextern" title="https://forum.openwrt.org" rel="ugc nofollow">ask on the Forum.</a></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Don&#039;t worry - If you try to upgrade with the wrong target, sysupgrade will refuse to proceed with an error message like this: <br/>
<code>Image version mismatch. image 1.1 device 1.0 Please wipe config during upgrade (force required) or reinstall. Config cannot be migrated from swconfig to DSA Image check failed</code></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The default root file system partition size changed for targets/devices relying on booting from mass storage (HDD, USB flash, SD card, etc.), so MBR will change and any additional partition will be deleted when sysupgrading.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If your device cannot be upgraded automatically, but it <em>will</em> support OpenWrt 21.02.0, you should backup your configuration, install manually, then re-create your configuration. As always if you have questions, <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org" class="urlextern" title="https://forum.openwrt.org" rel="ugc nofollow">feel free to ask on the Forum.</a></div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
That&#039;s it! Good luck with OpenWrt 21.02.0!
