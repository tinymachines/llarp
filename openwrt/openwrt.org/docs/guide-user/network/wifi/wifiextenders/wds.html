<p>
This network setup features a wireless access point and a wireless repeater. The access point connects to the main network via a wired connection and provides internet access. The repeater connects wirelessly to the access point as a client device, creating a point-to-point link that extends network and internet access to any devices connected to the repeater, whether wireless or wired. This configuration is ideal for extending Wi-Fi coverage in your area.

<p>
The setup described in this article establishes a backhaul link at layer 2 of the OSI model, allowing all broadcast packets, such as <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr> requests, to be transmitted in both directions over the link. The original MAC addresses of devices on both sides are preserved across the bridge.
</p>

<p>
Devices connected to both the access point and the repeater will share the same subnet, enabling visibility between them and facilitating the use of protocols like Zeroconf. Both the access point and the repeater remain accessible over the network.
</p>

<p>
Two wireless protocols can be used to achieve this: <abbr title="Wireless distribution system">WDS</abbr> and 802.11s mesh.
</p>

<p>
This document focuses on <abbr title="Wireless distribution system">WDS</abbr>. For 802.11s mesh, refer to <a href="/docs/guide-user/network/wifi/mesh/802-11s" class="wikilink1" title="docs:guide-user:network:wifi:mesh:802-11s" data-wiki-id="docs:guide-user:network:wifi:mesh:802-11s">802-11s</a>.
</p>

<p>
<abbr title="Wireless distribution system">WDS</abbr> (Wireless Distribution System) is required to create a network connection over a wireless link between the access point and the repeater. Although the IEEE 802.11-1999 standard defines <abbr title="Wireless distribution system">WDS</abbr> as a mechanism using a 4-address format, it does not specify implementation details, leading to potential issues when using <abbr title="Wireless distribution system">WDS</abbr> between devices from different chipset or firmware vendors. Therefore, <strong>it is recommended to use OpenWrt on both the access point and repeater</strong> to ensure compatibility and optimal performance. Most wireless drivers in OpenWrt support <abbr title="Wireless distribution system">WDS</abbr> mode.
</p>

<p>
If <abbr title="Wireless distribution system">WDS</abbr> or 802.11s mesh is not an option due to access point limitations, consider using <a href="/docs/guide-user/network/wifi/relay_configuration" class="wikilink1" title="docs:guide-user:network:wifi:relay_configuration" data-wiki-id="docs:guide-user:network:wifi:relay_configuration">Relayd - Wireless Repeater/Extender</a> or a <a href="/docs/guide-user/network/wifi/connect_client_wifi" class="wikilink1" title="docs:guide-user:network:wifi:connect_client_wifi" data-wiki-id="docs:guide-user:network:wifi:connect_client_wifi">simple wireless client</a>.

<div class="level4">

<p>
Open a terminal and connect to this device over <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr>. Make sure that this router has already been set up as a regular wireless access point and that wireless clients can connect to it fine. The procedure to do so is described at <a href="/docs/guide-quick-start/basic_wifi" class="wikilink1" title="docs:guide-quick-start:basic_wifi" data-wiki-id="docs:guide-quick-start:basic_wifi">Enabling a Wi-Fi access point on OpenWrt</a>.
</p>

<p>
Now, open the <a href="/docs/guide-user/network/wifi/basic" class="wikilink1" title="docs:guide-user:network:wifi:basic" data-wiki-id="docs:guide-user:network:wifi:basic">/etc/config/wireless</a> configuration file and add the following line to the <code>wifi-iface</code> section in use by the access point for operational network functionality:
</p>
<pre class="code">option wds &#039;1&#039;</pre>

<p>
Note that there may be multiple <code>wifi-iface</code> sections in this file, especially if the router is a dual-band device, in which case you need to ensure that you are editing the correct section.
</p>

<p>
This is an example of the <a href="/docs/guide-user/network/wifi/basic" class="wikilink1" title="docs:guide-user:network:wifi:basic" data-wiki-id="docs:guide-user:network:wifi:basic">/etc/config/wireless</a> file on an access point for the 2.4 <abbr title="Gigahertz">GHz</abbr> band:
</p>

<p>
/etc/config/wireless
</p>
<pre class="code">config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;
	option type &#039;mac80211&#039;
	option path &#039;platform/ahb/18100000.wmac&#039;
	option band &#039;2g&#039;
	option country &#039;US&#039;

config wifi-iface &#039;wifinet1&#039;
	option device &#039;radio0&#039;
	option network &#039;lan&#039;
	option mode &#039;ap&#039;
	option ssid &#039;My WiFi&#039;
	option encryption &#039;psk2&#039;
	option key &#039;MyWiFiPassword&#039;
	option wds &#039;1&#039;</pre>

<p>
Once that is done, save the file and reboot the device to apply the new network settings. Make sure that wireless clients are able to connect to this wireless access point and access the internet as well as they did with the old network configuration.
</p>

<p>
The <code>ip address</code> command should display a new network interface whose name is in the form of: “wlan.sta<strong>N</strong>”; where <strong>N</strong> is a number. This new interface must exist alongside the base “wlan<strong>N</strong>” wireless network interface. For example, if you get the “wlan.sta1” network interface, the base interface is “wlan1”.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> when tested on Barrier Breaker, there was no new interface created, neither on the <abbr title="Access Point">AP</abbr> nor on the STA, despite <abbr title="Wireless distribution system">WDS</abbr> working properly.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> The new wlan.staN interface will <strong>not</strong> be bridged by default with the originating <abbr title="Wireless Local Area Network">WLAN</abbr> interface if that interface is not itself part of a bridge. To correct this problem, you will need to create a new bridge interface in the wireless access point and associate only its <abbr title="Wireless Local Area Network">WLAN</abbr> interface to it.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="the_repeater">The repeater</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Initially, you might need to use an Ethernet cable to connect directly to the repeater and configure it. Open a terminal and connect to this device over <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr>.
</p>

<p>
There are some important settings on the repeater to take into account before creating the wireless link between the repeater and the access point. For starters, the repeater must have its <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr> server disabled (assuming there is already a different <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr> server working on the network). On fresh-installs of OpenWrt, the <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr> server is usually enabled by default on the <abbr title="Local Area Network">LAN</abbr> interface, so to disable it you need to change the network settings of the repeater.
</p>

<p>
Open the <a href="/docs/guide-user/base-system/dhcp" class="wikilink1" title="docs:guide-user:base-system:dhcp" data-wiki-id="docs:guide-user:base-system:dhcp">/etc/config/dhcp</a> file and add the following line to the <code>config dhcp &#039;lan&#039;</code> section:
</p>
<pre class="code">option ignore &#039;1&#039;</pre>

<p>
This line will disable the <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr> server on the <abbr title="Local Area Network">LAN</abbr> interface. The <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr> server should be already disabled on the <abbr title="Wireless Local Area Network">WLAN</abbr> interface, so save and close the file.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> On Chaos Calmer 15.05 / LuCI (git-15.248.30277-3836b45), the DHCP6 server had to be disabled as well, by changing <code>option dhcpv6 &#039;server&#039;</code> to <code>option dhcpv6 &#039;disabled&#039;</code>.
</p>

<p>
Now, you need to assign a network address other than the default static <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> assignment of 192.168.1.1/24 to the <abbr title="Local Area Network">LAN</abbr> interface, if it is already being used by a different device on your network. Open the <a href="/docs/guide-user/base-system/basic-networking" class="wikilink1" title="docs:guide-user:base-system:basic-networking" data-wiki-id="docs:guide-user:base-system:basic-networking">/etc/config/network</a> file and change the <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address to one from the same subnet. For example, to 192.168.1.2/24.
This is an example of the configuration file:
</p>

<p>
/etc/config/network
</p>
<pre class="code">config device
	option name &#039;br-lan&#039;
	option type &#039;bridge&#039;
	list ports &#039;eth0.1&#039;

config interface &#039;lan&#039;
	option device &#039;br-lan&#039;
	option proto &#039;static&#039;
	option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.2&#039;
	option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;</pre>

<p>
Alternatively, you may want to configure the repeater to fetch an <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address via <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr> from the access point, but that may leave the repeater inaccessible if the <abbr title="Wireless distribution system">WDS</abbr> connection does not work and it becomes unable to configure its network settings with <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr>. You would need to set the interface protocol to <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr>:
</p>

<p>
/etc/config/network
</p>
<pre class="code">config device
	option name &#039;br-lan&#039;
	option type &#039;bridge&#039;
	list ports &#039;eth0.1&#039;

config interface &#039;lan&#039;
	option device &#039;br-lan&#039;
	option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;</pre>

<p>
Reboot the repeater to apply the new network settings. After it has restarted, remember to reconnect to the repeater via <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr> on its new <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address. Keep in mind that the <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr> server is now disabled on its <abbr title="Local Area Network">LAN</abbr> network interface, so you might need to set a static <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address and subnet mask on the device you are using to configure the repeater.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> If you have set the <abbr title="Local Area Network">LAN</abbr> interface to use a dynamic <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address (<abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr> client), you will need to search for the repeater&#039;s <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address every time you reboot it.
</p>

<p>
It is time to setup the actual wireless link. Open the <a href="/docs/guide-user/network/wifi/basic" class="wikilink1" title="docs:guide-user:network:wifi:basic" data-wiki-id="docs:guide-user:network:wifi:basic">/etc/config/wireless</a> file and make sure the corresponding settings in the <code>radio<strong>N</strong></code> section (where <strong>N</strong> is a number) match the values in the same file of the access point. For example, to use the same band and country code.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, in this file, modify the <code>wifi-iface</code> section to set it in “sta” (client) mode, include the desired SSID to which to connect (the one broadcasted by the access point) and ensure <abbr title="Wireless distribution system">WDS</abbr> is enabled by setting this value to 1. The specific options may be different depending on the hardware but the SSID, channel, encryption type and password must match the access point, and <abbr title="Wireless distribution system">WDS</abbr> mode must be turned on.
</p>

<p>
<strong>If you want to enable wireless access</strong> to the repeater and, therefore, <strong>to the main network and the Internet</strong>, which you might want to do if your use case is <strong>expanding the Wi-Fi coverage on your location, an additional wireless interface (<code>wifi-iface</code>) is required in this file</strong>. Copy over the previous wifi-iface and:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Change the mode from <code>sta</code> to <code>ap</code>.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Remove the <code>option wds &#039;1&#039;</code> line.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In this new Wi-Fi interface on the repeater, the SSID and the secret key may be the same as the access points to allow transparent roaming, but they can also be different. As long as you connect this new interface to the <abbr title="Local Area Network">LAN</abbr> network, which is the default, your other wireless devices connecting through this <abbr title="Access Point">AP</abbr> will also be seen as part of the big network.
</p>

<p>
This is an example of the <a href="/docs/guide-user/network/wifi/basic" class="wikilink1" title="docs:guide-user:network:wifi:basic" data-wiki-id="docs:guide-user:network:wifi:basic">/etc/config/wireless</a> configuration file on a repeater for the 2.4 <abbr title="Gigahertz">GHz</abbr> band.

</p>

<p>
Disconnect the repeater from the wired network and reboot it, for example, by using its power button.
</p>

<p>
The repeater should boot and connect automatically to the access point wirelessly via <abbr title="Wireless distribution system">WDS</abbr>. It may take a few minutes for the repeater to associate and connect to the access point. Once this has happened, and if you decided to enable the <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr> client on the <abbr title="Local Area Network">LAN</abbr> interface (dynamic address), the wired interface of the repeater should succeed in getting a <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr> address through the new wireless backhaul connection. The wireless interface on the repeater does not get an <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address as it is now acting as a transparent bridge.
</p>

<p>
Any client devices connected to the repeater via an Ethernet cable (wired clients) should now be transparently connected into the main network over the wireless (<abbr title="Wireless distribution system">WDS</abbr>) link.
