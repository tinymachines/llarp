<div class="level1">

<p>
Unfortunately USB 3.0 and Wireless in the 2.4 <abbr title="Gigahertz">GHz</abbr> and even Bluetooth are interfering in the same frequency spectrum, which often causes problems.
See <a href="http://uk.pcmag.com/networking-reviews-ratings-comparisons/13179/opinion/wireless-witch-the-truth-about-usb-30-and-wi-fi-interference" class="urlextern" title="http://uk.pcmag.com/networking-reviews-ratings-comparisons/13179/opinion/wireless-witch-the-truth-about-usb-30-and-wi-fi-interference" rel="ugc nofollow">PC Mag Article about USB 3.0 and 2.4 GHz wireless issues</a>.
</p>

<p>
The problems caused by these interferences do not affect the drive activity, but can seriously impact your 2.4 <abbr title="Gigahertz">GHz</abbr> Wi-Fi, if there is an USB 3.0 storage device attached to your OpenWrt Wi-Fi device:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> 2.4 <abbr title="Gigahertz">GHz</abbr> Wi-Fi clients may be unable to connect to your 2.4 <abbr title="Gigahertz">GHz</abbr> Wi-Fi radio.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Already connected 2.4 <abbr title="Gigahertz">GHz</abbr> WiFi clients experience connection timeouts or seriously stalling or interrupted data transfers.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
These problems will most likely also appear, while the drive is idle.
</p>

<p>
Workarounds may vary for your situation, you may try:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Use 5 <abbr title="Gigahertz">GHz</abbr> Wi-Fi for your Wi-Fi client devices, as this problem only affects 2.4 <abbr title="Gigahertz">GHz</abbr> Wi-Fi.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Use an USB 2.0 drive casing instead of a USB 3.0, as USB 2.0 does not interfere in the 2.4 <abbr title="Gigahertz">GHz</abbr> spectrum or disable the USB3 driver to force fallback to USB 2.0. Many current OpenWrt devices aren&#039;t even noticably faster on USB3.0 data transfers compared to 2.0.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If your USB 3.0 storage device is an external USB3 harddrive drive, you could try a different casing that hopefully has better shielding.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You could try a different USB3.0 cable, it could be that the vendor-provided cable included with your USB 3.0 device might have bad shielding. But unfortunately several USB casing vendors use cables with proprietary USB connectors on the drive side that aren&#039;t easy to get in a better shielded variant on the market.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You could try to reposition your USB 3.0 storage device further away from your OpenWrt Wi-Fi device.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You could try a custom improvised shielding for your USB 3.0 storage device or the USB 3.0 cable, if you are technically gifted. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> It could even be that the power cable or a network cable connected to your OpenWrt Wi-Fi device has bad shielding.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You could try, if using a different and fixed channel for your 2.4 <abbr title="Gigahertz">GHz</abbr> radio slightly improves the issue: try channels 1, 6 and 11 and try Wi-Fi channel width 20 (if you were using 40 before).</div>
</li>
</ul>
