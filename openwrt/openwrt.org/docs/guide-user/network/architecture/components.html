This section is intended as a primer for how to setup a home or small office network.
The following explanation is intended as a basic intro into the components and their respective roles. As always in networking (as it was intended from the beginning) there multiple ways of setting up the topology, depending on the goals you are trying to achieve.

The following picture describes the ideal layout of a network using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_network" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_network">Star topology</a> as this gives every client maximum performance (highest bandwidth, lowest latency) when reaching every other component and the internet.

<div class="level2">

<p>
Due to the difficulties implementing the Star topology, mainly cause by the need to run physical connections between every present and future client to a central location, the most common topology in practice is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_network" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_network">Tree Network</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> This has the advantage of running only one (or small number) of physical connections to the central switch</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> But has the disadvantage of having this connection as a potential bottleneck for bandwidth, as well as increasing the latency because every switch will necessarily have to receive and forward the network packages</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Below are two examples of this topology where the function of the Router, Firewall, <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr>, Switch and Access point are been provided by a single device, plus one or more additional downstream switches.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If additional switches <em>must</em> be deployed, ideally there should only be one.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If two downstream switches <em>must</em> be deployed, then both of these should ideally be connected to the main switch, <strong>NOT</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_chain_(electrical_engineering)" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_chain_(electrical_engineering)">daisy chained</a></div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Single downstream switch</div>

</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> In this example there is only one downstream switch connected trough an higher bandwidth SFP back to the main router to reduce the effect of the bottleneck between the downstream switch and the router&#039;s internal switch</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The server is also connected trough an high speed SFP (e.g. Direct Attach Copper Cable SFP+) back to the internal switch of the router</div>
</li>

</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Multiple downstream switches</div>

</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> In this example there are two switches downstream from the internal router&#039;s switch. Possible reasons for such a setup would be having one high speed switch (2.5GbE) and one low speed (1GbE or 100MbE) switch providing PoE for TVs and security cameras</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Keep in mind that if any packages from clients in the downstream switches to clients of another downstream switch will have to traverse three switches to reach their target.</div>

<p>
<strong>Most importantly</strong>: All clients (and of course switches) that can be connected using physical connections (Ethernet, SFP+) should be connected. The reason is because when using roads as an analogy:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Physical connections are like a private <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway">Controlled-access_highway</a>, where the communication is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)#Full_duplex" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)#Full_duplex">Full_duplex</a> (in the vast majority of cases). </div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> This means that a 1GbE connection can do 1GbE download and 1GbE upload <strong>at the same time</strong> (for a total bidirectional speed of 2GbE) but will <strong>not</strong> do 2GbE in any single direction.

The following section describes possibilities when choosing components, not as an exhaustive list. Ever since it&#039;s inception at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a> the networking layer is designed to work with a wide range of equipment and provide redundancy in case one path fails.

</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Having hardware flow offloading (and if implemented by OpenWRT for that device) decreases the necessary processing power, as the packages are forwarded without analysis but that makes it incompatible with SQM</div>
