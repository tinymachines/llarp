OpenWrt has the following ways to configure your device
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> There is <a href="/docs/guide-user/base-system/uci" class="wikilink1" title="docs:guide-user:base-system:uci" data-wiki-id="docs:guide-user:base-system:uci">UCI</a> to store and manipulate all its configuration. This is a OpenWrt system to configure base services and many additional packages from a central standardized point.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> There is LuCI - a web interface for UCI, by default usually listening at <code>http://192.168.1.1/</code> or <code>http://openwrt.lan/</code>. Not all devices with less than 8MB of Flash ROM have LuCI available, as LuCI requires about 1MB of flash space. LuCI is based on Lua and its a OpenWrt own standard as well. You can also enable <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure">HTTPS</abbr> for LuCI access. Not all options may be available in LuCI.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> There are several classic Linux config files also used in on OpenWrt devices. These files use the same format and config options as in other Linux distributions.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Optional installable packages sometimes integrate into the UCI config model and may also provide a LuCI config extension, but many extension packages also bring their own config files.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
When using the command line or the web interface to modify values, all changes are staged and not saved to the file directly, so <strong>remember to save the changes after you have set them.</strong>
