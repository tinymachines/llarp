<div class="level1">

<p>
If you have set your OpenWrt device to become a network client (e.g. to use it as wifi access point only), you most likely will have purposely turned off <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr> and you will have removed the static <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address from OpenWrt configuration. As a result, the OpenWrt device will no longer be listening to <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr> or LuCi/http (or whatever you had used as address range before), rendering the device inaccessible on first sight.<br/>

</p>

<p>
But both the <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr> deamon and LuCi are still active, just their listening <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address will be different. There is no need to boot the OpenWrt device into fail-safe mode to regain access. Simply connect the OpenWrt device (<abbr title="Wide Area Network">WAN</abbr> port) to the <abbr title="Local Area Network">LAN</abbr> port of another router that has <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr> enabled.<br/>

</p>

<p>
Then check the status page of the other router and note the <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address that got issued from the other router to your OpenWrt device (or do a network scan from a client). This <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address will then need to be used for <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr> and LUCI access to the OpenWrt device.
