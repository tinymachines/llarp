I suggest “the nerd” strategy.

<h2 class="sectionedit2" id="the_ostrich">The ostrich</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
The ostrich doesn&#039;t need logs. In case something goes wrong, the ostrich prefers to not know, because that way, they are quasi innocent, because they “didn&#039;t know”. Of course in court this doesn&#039;t really matter, as the admin is responsible for any disturbance their system may cause. To avoid unnecessary breakdowns, an admin has to keep themself informed. The ostrich ignores that.

<h2 class="sectionedit3" id="the_beginner">The beginner</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
The beginner logs to impress their friends and gain prestige in the community. Without much thinking they log a lot.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Logs everything, uses the <code>logger</code> command to arbitrarily produce even more logs.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Does not distinguish between useful or not, reads all logs and posts them online.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> After a while, stops reading their logs at all (too much to read...)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Does not know what exactly the logs mean.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Ignores the law, doesn&#039;t mind the <em>privacy</em> of other users your logs may breach.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Does not inform that they log, what they log and for how long logs are being kept, because it is a secret (you know, for security reasons)</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Makes logs accessible to everyone, especially to people they do not concern (necessary breach of security to impress people in the forums)</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It may look like certain people would like to introduce this strategy for logging every Internet activity in Germany. But that cannot be, as this would be stupid.

<h2 class="sectionedit4" id="the_nerd">The nerd</h2>

<p>
The nerd knows a little about the possibilities of the programs running on the systems. So, during <em>normal service</em> they create logs
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> To WARN and <em>reads these logs regularly</em></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Log messages that might prove useful to be able to reconstruct things, and <em>reads them only when needed</em></div>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> They act as <em>Data Protection Officer</em> and informs other users (whom it may concern) of the fact</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> That logs are being created and stored</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> <em>How long</em> logs are being stored</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> <em>Who</em> has access to the logs</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Only during <em>debug sessions</em> they
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Log everything</div>

<div class="level2">

<p>
Pretty much the same as the nerd, but the professional gets paid for solving breakage fast. Some get important log warning per SMS or per pager. Day and night. Yay.
