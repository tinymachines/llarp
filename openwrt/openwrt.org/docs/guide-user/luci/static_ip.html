<p>
This page is a lite version of Static leases comparing with that in the usual  LuCI interface (Network → <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr> and <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> → Static Leases).<br/>

</p>

<p>
Static leases are used to assign fixed <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses and symbolic hostnames to <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr> clients. They are also required for non-dynamic interface configurations where only hosts with a corresponding lease are served.<br/>

</p>

<p>
<strong>Attention: </strong>It is not available yet with LuCI interface.<br/>

</p>

<p>
This version keeps the essential configurations: Hostname, MAC-Address, and <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 4">IPv4</abbr>-Address.<br/>

When you select a MAC-Address within the list, the <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 4">IPv4</abbr>-Address associated with the MAC-Address is shown behind.<br/>

If you have added this static lease before, it is the hostname shown behind the MAC-Address/<abbr title="Internet Protocol version 4">IPv4</abbr>-Address.<br/>

</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the users don&#039;t have to enter a new window to create or modify a static lease, that means, they can manipulate on the showing page, which simplifies the use of the interface.<br/>
