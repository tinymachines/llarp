<p>
Imagination’s MIPS64 architecture has been used in a variety of applications including game consoles, office automation and set-top boxes, and maintains popularity today in networking and telecommunications infrastructure applications. As design complexity and software footprints increase, the benefits of 64-bit computing become attractive to a broader set of applications including servers, next generation mobile and connected consumer devices and SOHO networking products.
</p>

<p>
The MIPS64® architecture provides a solid high-performance foundation for future MIPS processor-based development by incorporating powerful features, standardizing privileged mode instructions, supporting past ISAs, and providing a seamless upgrade path from the MIPS32 architecture.
</p>

<p>
The MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures incorporate important functionality including SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) and virtualization. These technologies, in conjunction with technologies such as multi-threading (MT), DSP extensions and EVA (Enhanced Virtual Addressing), enrich the architecture for use with modern software workloads which require larger memory sizes, increased computational horsepower and secure execution environments.
</p>

<p>
The MIPS64 architecture is based on a fixed-length, regularly encoded instruction set, and it uses a load/store data model. It is streamlined to support optimized execution of high-level languages. Arithmetic and logic operations use a three-operand format, allowing compilers to optimize complex expressions formulation. Availability of 32 general-purpose registers enables compilers to further optimize code generation by keeping frequently accessed data in registers.
</p>

<p>
By providing backward compatibility, standardizing privileged mode, and memory management and providing the information through the configuration registers, the MIPS64 architecture enables real-time operating systems and application code to be implemented once and reused with future members of both the MIPS32 and the MIPS64 processor families.
</p>

<p>
<strong>High-Perfomance Caches</strong><br/>

Flexibility of high-performance caches and memory management schemes are strengths of the MIPS architecture. The MIPS64 architecture extends these advantages with well-defined cache control options. The size of the instruction and data caches can range from 256 bytes to 4 <abbr title="Megabyte">MB</abbr>. The data cache can employ either a write-back or write-through policy. A no-cache option can also be specified. The memory management mechanism can employ either a TLB or a Block Address Translation (BAT) policy. With a TLB, the MIPS64 architecture meets the memory management requirements of Linux, Android™, Windows® CE and other historically popular operating systems.
</p>

<p>
The addition of data streaming and predicated operations supports the increasing computation needs of the embedded market. Conditional data move and data prefetch instructions are standardized, allowing for improved system-level data throughput in communication and multimedia applications.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Fixed-Point DSP-Type Instructions</strong><br/>

Fixed-point DSP-type instructions further enhance multimedia processing. These instructions that include Multiply (MUL), Multiply and Add (MADD), Multiply and Subtract (MSUB), and “count leading 0s/1s,” previously available only on some 64-bit MIPS processors, provide greater performance in processing data streams such as audio, video, and multimedia without adding additional DSP hardware to the system.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Powerful 64-bit Floating-Point Registers</strong><br/>

Powerful 64-bit floating-point registers and execution units speed the tasks of processing some DSP algorithms and calculating graphics operations in real-time. Paired-single instructions pack two 32-bit floating-point operands into a single 64-bit register, allowing Single Instruction Multiple Data operations (SIMD). This provides twice as fast execution compared to traditional 32-bit floating-point units. Floating point operations can optionally be emulated in software.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Addressing Modes</strong><br/>

The MIPS64 architecture features both 32-bit and 64-bit addressing modes, while working with 64-bit data. This allows reaping the benefits of 64-bit data without the extra memory needed for 64-bit addressing. In order to allow easy migration from the 32-bit family, the architecture features a 32-bit compatibility mode, in which all registers and addresses are 32-bit wide and all instructions present in the MIPS32 architecture are executed.
