Original text below:
ARMv8-A introduces 64-bit architecture support to the ARM architecture and includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> 64-bit general purpose registers, SP (stack pointer)  and PC (program counter)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> 64-bit data processing and extended virtual addressing </div>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Two main execution states:</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li">  AArch64 - The 64-bit execution state including exception model, memory model, programmers&#039; model and instruction set support for that state</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li">  AArch32 - The 32-bit execution state including exception model, memory model, programmers&#039; model and instruction set support for that state</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The execution states support three key instruction sets:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A32 (or ARM): a 32-bit fixed length instruction set, enhanced through the different architecture variants. Part of the 32-bit architecture execution environment now referred to as AArch32.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> T32 (Thumb) introduced as a 16-bit fixed-length instruction set, subsequently enhanced to a mixed-length 16- and 32-bit instruction set on the introduction of Thumb-2 technology. Part of the 32-bit architecture execution environment now referred to as AArch32. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A64 is a 64-bit fixed-length instruction set that offers similar functionality to the ARM and Thumb instruction sets. Introduced with ARMv8-A, it is the AArch64 instruction set. </div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
ARM ISAs are constantly improving to meet the increasing demands of leading edge applications developers, while retaining the backwards compatibility necessary to protect investment in software development. In ARMv8-A there are some additions to A32 and T32 to maintain alignment with the A64 instruction set.
