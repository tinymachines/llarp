# PSPBoot

[PSPboot](http://wikibin.org/articles/pspboot.html "http://wikibin.org/articles/pspboot.html") is the successor of [adam2](/docs/techref/bootloader/adam2 "docs:techref:bootloader:adam2") but only slightly backwards compatible with it. See [Adam2\_versus\_PSP\_bootloader](http://wikibin.org/articles/adam2.html "http://wikibin.org/articles/adam2.html"). It is the bootloader used e.g. on the Linksys WAG354G, WRTP54G and [ADSL2MUE](http://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/ADSL2MUE "http://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/ADSL2MUE") as well as the [https://oldwiki.archive.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/sc101](https://oldwiki.archive.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/sc101 "https://oldwiki.archive.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/sc101").

## User Guide

Here is the user guide of PSPBoot version 1.2:

- [pspboot-user-guide.pdf](/_media/media/doc/pspboot-user-guide.pdf "media:doc:pspboot-user-guide.pdf (185.7 KB)")

What the guide is not saying is that the “boot” command supports placing a kernel command line. Every argument after “boot” gets passed.

## TFTP flashing

PSPBoot accepts a TFTP upload of a new firmware while beeing in command line mode or during the boot wait. The boot wait is 3 seconds by default. This creates a very narrow windows for uploading. TFTP is possible at about 2 seconds after powerup for about 1 second.

With a serial console attached, it is also possible to stop the boot process by pressing ESC. The bootloader will then continue to accept uploads. The uploaded file has to be called upgrade\_code.bin .

Without serial console, this procedure was successful on wag354g:

- unplug the router
- set static a configuration to the nic, with ip 192.168.1.xx(2-254) and netmask 255.255.255.0
- launch tftp:

```
        tftp> verbose           (for debugging purpose)
        tftp> trace             ( "     "       "     )
        tftp> rexmt 1
        tftp> timeout 5
        tftp> binary
        tftp> connect 192.168.1.1
```

- plug the power to the router
- wait until the led switch turns on, and immediately enter:

```
tftp> put upgrade_code.bin
```

- alternatively, just dont wait to press enter, and do some try till the right timing is guessed.

If transfer starts, the tftp output is like this:

```
....
sent DATA 
		received ACK 
...
```

- wait until router reboots
