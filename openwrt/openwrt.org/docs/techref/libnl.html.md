# libnl and libnl-tiny â€“ Technical Reference

`libnl` is a library for applications dealing with netlink sockets, for instance to retrieve or change routing information, interface settings, and is used more generally when communicating with the kernel.

## libnl

The upstream version of `libnl` is maintained at [http://www.infradead.org/~tgr/libnl/](http://www.infradead.org/~tgr/libnl/ "http://www.infradead.org/~tgr/libnl/")

Since `libnl` is somewhat heavyweight, it is not included by default on OpenWRT. If you need only basic netlink functionalities, you may want to use `libnl-tiny` instead. However, some applications require the full features of `libnl`.

Since [r47037](https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/47037 "https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/47037"), the `libnl` package has been split into multiple components. The sizes below are approximate sizes after compression, based on the `ar71xx` target with musl:

Name Size Description `libnl-core` 37K Common code for all netlink libraries `libnl-genl` 8K Generic Netlink Library Functions `libnl-nf` 25K Netfilter Netlink Library Functions `libnl-route` 91K Routing Netlink Library Functions

For compatibility, a meta-package name `libnl` depends on all the above packages.

## libnl-tiny

The `libnl-tiny` package is a stripped down version of libnl, included by default on OpenWRT.

The code is maintained directly in the OpenWRT code tree, see [http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a=tree;f=package/libs/libnl-tiny](http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git%3Ba%3Dtree%3Bf%3Dpackage%2Flibs%2Flibnl-tiny "http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a=tree;f=package/libs/libnl-tiny")

Name Size Description `libnl-tiny` 14K Drop-in replacement for most of `libnl-core` and `libnl-genl`

`libnl-tiny` replaces the most commonly used parts of `libnl-core` and `libnl-genl`. The API is a bit more limited, but compatible for most applications. The ABI is different, but that doesn't matter much.

Any package that can easily work with `libnl-tiny` instead of `libnl` should be changed to make use of it, since `libnl-tiny` is usually part of the default package set.

However, mixing `libnl`-based libraries with `libnl-tiny` does not work.
