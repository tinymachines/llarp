# Mounting Block Devices

This pages discuses the advanced details and underlying operation. For general usage, see [fstab](/docs/guide-user/storage/fstab "docs:guide-user:storage:fstab").

## Overview

The mounting of block devices is handled by the `block-mount` source package, which contains the `block-mount` and `block-hotplug` packages. `block-mount` contains the code that does the actual mounting, and the mounting via `/etc/init.d/fstab` (i.e. on boot rather than when device is hotplugged), and `block-hotplug` takes care of mounting devices when the device is recognized by the system (.e.g. when modules are loaded and the partition detected).

## block-mount (binary package)

The `block-mount` binary package (i.e. the one you actually install, rather than the source package containing `block-mount` and `block-hotplug`), contains three library scripts (in addition to `/etc/init.d/fstab` and the sample config file `/etc/config/fstab`). These three scripts are: `block.sh`, `mount.sh`, and `fsck.sh`.

![](/_media/meta/icons/tango/48px-outdated.svg.png) As of [r26314](https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/26314/trunk "https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/26314/trunk") `block-extroot` and `block-hotplug` have been merged with `block-mount`. That means that once you install `block-mount` the scripts for [extroot](/docs/guide-user/additional-software/extroot_configuration "docs:guide-user:additional-software:extroot_configuration") mounting and hotplug mounting are installed. With [r36988](https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/36988 "https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/36988") the original package `block-mount` was removed. Technically, the new package `ubox` replaced its functionality. For [Fstab configuration](/docs/guide-user/storage/fstab "docs:guide-user:storage:fstab"), the new block-mount package now contains the executable `block` which facilitates this. You can run `block <info|mount|umount|detect>`. See [Fstab configuration](/docs/guide-user/storage/fstab "docs:guide-user:storage:fstab").

With the new block mount mechanism you can run `block info` to get the same output that blkid delivered (however it only returns info for filesystems it supports). You can do “block mount” to mount all devices (same as what `/etc/init.d/fstab restart` used to do. If you run “`block detect`” you will get a sample uci file for the currently attached block devices. That way you can do “`block detect | uci import fstab`” to store it

![:!:](/lib/images/smileys/exclaim.svg) block info cannot detect btrfs (added [r43868](https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/43868/trunk "https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/43868/trunk")), xfs , jfs, ntfs, exfat, and some other FS. Use manual scripting to mount them.

### The new block-mount in Barrier Breaker

#### Usage: block &lt;info|mount|umount|detect&gt;

- **info** → get the same output that blkid delivered (including mtdblock)

```

```

- **mount** → mount all devices listed in fstab
- **umount** → unmount all devices listed in fstab
- **detect** → get a sample uci file for the currently attached block devices

```
config 'global'
	option	anon_swap	'0'
	option	anon_mount	'0'
	option	auto_swap	'1'
	option	auto_mount	'1'

	option	enabled	'0'
	option	options	'lazytime,noatime,background_gc=off,gc_merge'
```

you can do “`block detect | uci import fstab`” to store it as a sample config file (already with UUID ![;-)](/lib/images/smileys/wink.svg) )

## block-hotplug (binary package)

Block hotplug consists of three scripts, `10-swap`, `20-fsck`, and `40-mount`. When a block devices is added these scripts are executed in the order listed. So, first the device is checked for being a `swap` section, or to attempt to mount as swap, if it is not a defined section for swap or mount (this is known as `anon_swap` or anonymous swap). Then `20-fsck` checks if the device is listed as `enabled_fsck` and if so, attempts to check/repair the filesystem, and, finally, we check if the device should be mounted, either named, or anonymously (i.e. not listed in any section).

with the mount command instead of block mount/block umount

[2)](#fnt__2)

use btrfs-show to get the UUID
