<p>
Your device still needs to have the vendor&#039;s firmware installed to be eligible for this so-called “factory install” procedure.
</p>

<p>
- Go to the <a href="/supported_devices" class="wikilink1" title="supported_devices" data-wiki-id="supported_devices">Supported Devices</a> page and click on the question that best fits your search.
- Familiarize yourself with the <strong>Devices Page</strong> (listed in the linked devices table above). There you will find specific installation information, caveats, tips, tricks, and other important information that you need to know BEFORE you go out and buy a device. It also serves as a way to gauge the “popularity” of the device, as more popular devices usually have more comprehensive pages.
- If you are looking to buy a new router for OpenWrt, look for devices with a compatible integrated circuit (SoC), 16 <abbr title="Megabyte">MB</abbr> of Flash, and 128 <abbr title="Megabyte">MB</abbr> of RAM at minimum.

You will now use a checksum tool, to calculate a checksum from your downloaded file and then compare this calculated checksum  with the file-specific checksum listed on the firmware download site. This ensures that you will not brick your device due to a faulty download.
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Check your downloaded “...factory.bin” file according to <a href="/docs/guide-quick-start/verify_firmware_checksum" class="wikilink1" title="docs:guide-quick-start:verify_firmware_checksum" data-wiki-id="docs:guide-quick-start:verify_firmware_checksum">checksum verification of downloaded OpenWrt firmware files</a>.</div>

Troubleshooting:
