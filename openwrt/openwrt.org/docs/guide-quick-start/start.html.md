# Quick start guide for OpenWrt installation

So you want to install OpenWrt on one of your devices.

The following preparation is recommended, before flashing OpenWrt firmware:

- Don't rush the installation, take your time. If something seems weird during installation, find answers first before continuing.
- Have your device's precise model name (and if applicable, exact hardware version or generation number) at hand, so you are able to select the correct OpenWrt firmware.
- Have your device's documentation at hand, on how to flash new firmware.
- When installing and configuring OpenWrt on your Internet router, your Internet-access will obviously be offline for a few minutes. Please ensure that you have all required information offline or have backup Internet access at hand in this time.

If you have any questions:

- Browse this site, especially the [User guide](/docs/guide-user/start "docs:guide-user:start") section.
- Feel free to ask in the [OpenWrt forum](/contact#forum "contact").
- You can also consult the [old OpenWrt wiki](/historicalwiki "historicalwiki") if you are looking for legacy information.
- Follow the [factory install how-to](/docs/guide-quick-start/factory_installation "docs:guide-quick-start:factory_installation") to install OpenWrt on your device.
