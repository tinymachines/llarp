I'll create a comprehensive bash script that collects OpenWRT router configurations and system information in an organized format. This will be useful for managing multiple routers and troubleshooting.I've created a comprehensive OpenWRT configuration scanner script that will help you manage multiple routers. Here's what the script does:

## Key Features:

1. **Comprehensive Data Collection**:
   - UCI configuration files (network, wireless, firewall, dhcp, etc.)
   - Raw configuration files from /etc/config/
   - System information (kernel, OpenWRT version, hardware)
   - Network configuration (interfaces, routes, firewall rules)
   - Service status and running processes
   - DHCP leases and wireless information
   - System and kernel logs

2. **Organized Output Structure**:
   ```
   router_configs/
   ├── hostname_IP_timestamp/
   │   ├── configs/          # Configuration files
   │   ├── system/           # System information
   │   ├── network/          # Network configuration
   │   ├── logs/             # System logs
   │   ├── services/         # Service information
   │   ├── metadata.json     # Scan metadata
   │   ├── summary_report.txt # Human-readable summary
   │   └── inventory.json    # Machine-readable inventory
   └── compare_routers.sh    # Comparison helper script
   ```

3. **Additional Features**:
   - Timestamp-based versioning for tracking changes over time
   - Color-coded output for easy reading
   - Error handling and connection testing
   - Creates both human-readable summaries and machine-readable JSON
   - Generates a comparison script to diff configurations between routers
   - Archives the entire configuration for easy transfer

## Usage:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x openwrt_scanner.sh

# Scan a single router
./openwrt_scanner.sh 192.168.1.1

# Scan with custom output directory
./openwrt_scanner.sh 192.168.1.1 /path/to/configs

# Scan multiple routers
for ip in 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3; do
    ./openwrt_scanner.sh $ip
done
```

## For Configuration Management:

Since you mentioned using this data to configure routers, here's a companion script that can apply configurations:I've also created a configuration applier script. Here's one more useful script for managing multiple routers - a batch scanner with network-wide reporting:## Complete OpenWRT Configuration Management Suite

I've created a comprehensive suite of three scripts for managing your OpenWRT routers:

### 1. **Scanner Script** (`openwrt_scanner.sh`)
- Collects complete router configurations
- Organizes data in a structured directory format
- Creates both human-readable and machine-readable outputs
- Includes comparison tools

### 2. **Configuration Applier** (`openwrt_applier.sh`)
Features:
- Apply configurations from one router to another
- Dry-run mode to preview changes
- Selective configuration application
- Automatic backup before changes
- Service restart management

Usage:
```bash
# Preview changes without applying
./openwrt_applier.sh 192.168.1.2 ./router_configs/router1_config --dry-run

# Apply all configurations
./openwrt_applier.sh 192.168.1.2 ./router_configs/router1_config

# Selectively apply configurations
./openwrt_applier.sh 192.168.1.2 ./router_configs/router1_config --selective
```

### 3. **Batch Scanner with Network Report** (`batch_scanner.sh`)
Features:
- Scan multiple routers in one run
- Generate HTML network report
- Create network-wide inventory
- Package analysis across routers
- Network topology visualization

Usage:
```bash
# Create a file with router IPs
cat > routers.txt << EOF
192.168.1.1
192.168.1.2
10.0.0.1
EOF

# Run batch scan
./batch_scanner.sh routers.txt
```

## Key Benefits:

1. **Version Control Ready**: All outputs are text-based and can be committed to git
2. **Comparison Tools**: Easy to diff configurations between routers or over time
3. **Automation Friendly**: JSON outputs for scripting and automation
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Collects all relevant router data
5. **Safe Operations**: Includes dry-run modes and automatic backups

## Typical Workflow:

```bash
# 1. Initial scan of all routers
./batch_scanner.sh routers.txt

# 2. Make configuration changes on one router
# (configure manually via LuCI or SSH)

# 3. Capture the new configuration
./openwrt_scanner.sh 192.168.1.1

# 4. Apply to other routers
for ip in 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3; do
    ./openwrt_applier.sh $ip ./router_configs/latest_config/
done

# 5. Verify changes
./batch_scanner.sh routers.txt
```

These scripts should give you a complete solution for managing your OpenWRT router fleet. The data format is designed to be both human-readable for troubleshooting and machine-readable for automation.
